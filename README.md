MinecraftWilderness
===================

Minecraft plugin that periodically reloads every chunk that does not contain a chest.

Add a chest to any chunk that you want to keep. If you later no longer want to keep it, just remove the chest.

The see will be changed periodically, and all chest-free chunks will be reloaded. This effectively causes your base to be in the wilderness all the time.
